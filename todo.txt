math planning
- templated on base type and size
- typedefs for common types/sizes e.g. float3
- maker functions, not constructors
- free functions, not member functions

affine math planning
- vector3/point3 based on low-level float3
- affine xfm based on low-level float3x3
- projective xfm
- grassmann algebra?

simd math planning
- 4-wide SoA layout
- functions to transform between SoA/AoS layouts
